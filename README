Shopzilla Publisher API Client
------------------------------

This library allows registered members of the Shopzilla publisher program to programmatically access the Shopzilla
Catalog API. See http://publisher.shopzilla.com for more information.

To get started:
1) Make sure you have a recent version of the java JDK installed (1.6.x). Set JAVA_HOME as necessary in your terminal.
   Verify that this is correctly configured by running:

     java -version

2) Install Maven 2.x; Verify that this is correctly configured by running the following command in your terminal; You
   should see a usage/help output:

     mvn

3) Fetch a copy of this code (after making sure that you've installed git):

     git clone https://sz-alook@github.com/shopzilla/catalog-api-client.git

4) Set up environment variables with your Shopzilla publisher api key and id:

     export PUBLISHER_ID=<your id>
     export PUBLISHER_API_KEY=<your api key>

   Optionally you can pass your Shopzilla publisher api key and id through maven as arguments.

5) Run the following command to build the code and make sample requests against the Catalog API:
     
     mvn clean install
     (requires environment variables to be set)

     or
     mvn clean install -DPUBLISHER_ID=<your id> -DPUBLISHER_API_KEY=<your api key>

   You should see output towards the end that looks as below (with your credentials instead of <KEY>/<ID>). This is the
   Url used to retrieve the product data. If you browse to this URL, you'll see an example of what data is available
   from this type of query.

        2011-04-07 21:50:57,742 DEBUG [org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate] - <Created GET request for
        "catalog.bizrate.com/services/catalog/v1/us/product?apiKey=<KEY>&publisherId=<ID>&placementId=1&
        categoryId=&keyword=nike+men%2527s+shoes&productId=&productIdType=&offersOnly=false&merchantId=&brandId=&
        biddedOnly=&minPrice=&maxPrice=&minMarkdown=&zipCode=&freeShipping=&start=0&results=10&startOffers=0&

   There are domain object available, corresponding to the XML elements in this XML response. See the XSD schema, in
   model/src/main/resources/service.xsd for a full description. Additionally, if you view the source code in the folder
   model/target/generated-sources/xjc you can see a series of Java objects representing the data returned by the API.

   ProductClient.java, for instance, returns a ProductResponse object, with methods getOffers(), getProducts(), etc.
   These calls can be integrated into your applications as you please.

6) Make cool applications!
